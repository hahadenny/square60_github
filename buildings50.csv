Presently, it’s the tallest residential building in New York City.  Mr. Trump bought the air rights of seven surrounding properties to build the majestic building that soars 863 feet into Manhattan’s skyline.  Construction costs for the project were approximately $3-400 million and the amenities and design most certainly reflect that.    Trump World Tower appears as a shining, bronze and black beauty of glass and is one of the slenderest towers in New York City.  Built in 2001, its presence stands out among the charming, tree-lined neighborhood of Turtle Bay, named for a 40-acre tract of land that emptied into a bay of the East River in the early 1600s.      Residents have access to a public plaza along East 47th Street, surrounded by lush landscaping and their home entrance is a two-story marbled lobby.  This is five-star living where the rich and famous frequent and live.  Studios to four-bedroom apartments have imported marble in the baths, 10-16-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, herringboned maple floors and top-of-the line appliances in the spacious kitchens.  Penthouse apartments have 360 degree panoramic views of Central Park and Manhattan.    In 2003, the International Real Estate Federation (FIABCI) awarded Trump World Tower the “Best Residential Project in the World” for its superior design and amenities.

In this stunning building, Dutch architect Piet Boon brings the elements that have made him an international design talent to a location reminiscent of his native Holland. With Oosten, he pays homage to his Dutch heritage with clean, streamlined elements that get more beautiful over time, and which harken back to the history of the neighborhood in which it is situated.     Consisting of 216 units and encompassing an entire block, Oosten makes a dramatic statement in South Williamsburg. The building’s façade is articulated using local materials that only improve with age and is a modern interpretation of the area’s industrial past. Gunmetal framing windows mingle with brick to create an homage to the Williamsburg Bridge, as well as to the area’s rich building heritage. Oosten’s seven different unit typologies (townhomes, duplex homes, 1-, 2-, & 3-bedrooms, lofts, and duplex penthouses), articulated on the exterior, express the range of the building and create an amazing variation on the façade.    For the interiors, Boon’s designs are quintessentially Dutch, and exemplify a perfect mix of practicality, humanity and humor. Homes are designed in the Dutch tradition, with light and dark finishing packages available to residents, both palettes serene and neutral. Concrete and steel mingle with green and organic elements, and floor-to-ceiling windows and lush patios bring the outdoors in.

The original art-deco style clubhouse was built in 1930 and designed by Starrett & van Vleck, the firm behind many New York department stores including Bloomingdales and Saks Fifth Avenue. The building served as a member’s only social and athletic club until 2011 when in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks much commercial and residential activity in Lower Manhattan shut down. In 2002, the club declared bankruptcy.    In 2005, the Downtown Club re-opened as a residential tower after a major renovation. The signature art deco style of the highrise contributed to its designation as a city landmark in 2000. With orange brick, skillful masonry, and decorative facades, the building is a testament to its style and the building conventions of its time.    Each unit in 20 West Street contains stainless steel GE appliances and granite countertops in the kitchen, as well as Italian marble in the bathroom. There are studio as well as one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments available, some of which have private outdoor terraces. The building has a 24-hour concierge service and features amenities including a valet service, fitness center, residential lounge, common terrace, and indoor bicycle storage.     Located in the Financial District at the southern tip of Manhattan, 20 West Street is within walking distance of eateries, retailers, and public transportation, including ferries to other destinations.

The building was designed by the award-winning architectural firm, Costas Kondylis & Partners and is self-managed by the Board President Daniel Neiditch who continues to add amenities and cut costs. Equal parts resort, art gallery and private club, the Atelier contains 475 units that sport sumptuous views of Manhattan and the Hudson River. And, just to make sure it really earned its place among head-turning NYC condo towers, the Atelier in 2013 posted for sale the entire 45th floor for a jaw-dropping $85 million.    Mostly, however, the Atelier building contains studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom condominiums, which still command a premium price.The management has turned the Atelier into a Green Building and is now the tallest residential building with solar power on the roof in the country. The Atelier is loaded with amenities that even the most jaded buyer or tenant winds up gloating over: A sky-lit indoor pool; a 12,000-square-foot health club; a jaw-dropping rooftop lounge; rooftop terraces; daily breakfast in the lobby, basketball court; tennis court, golf driving range; movie theater; barbecue grills; on-site storage; free bicycles for use; crosstown shuttle bus and free daily breakfast. As of 2014 the Atelier has put in place a one of a kind ice skating rink on the roof top for the Winter. For families with children the building has an indoor and outdoor play areas as well as weekly music classes and movie nights.    The common theme among Atelier residents is that they feel taken care if not downright pampered by the staff and services at their disposal. The Atelier also features 15,700 square feet of ground-floor retail space and a 100-vehicle subterranean parking garage. Each unit comes with a high-end kitchen, washer and dryer, over-sized windows, white oak floors, wiring for cable, telephone, and Internet. Atelier concierge services draw pretty rave reviews from residents, who can get groceries delivered and stored and heavy packages delivered direct to their unit. That’s inside.    Out the front door there’s access to just about everything that makes living in Manhattan one of the most rarefied experiences on the planet: Tons of restaurants, cafes, stores, galleries and most importantly, immediate access to the Hudson River Park and Pier 84, located just a block away. Residents also come to appreciate that being on 11th Ave., you escape a lot of the noise, exhaust and hustle and bustle of 42nd St. at Times Square while still having amazing access.
